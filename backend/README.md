## Usage ##

Run `npm start`. This should both run the local server and launch your browser.

If your browser fails to launch, or shows a 404 error, navigate your browser to http://localhost:8080.

The app should reload automatically when you make a change to a file.

Use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the local server.
